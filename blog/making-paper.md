# Making Paper

No, I'm not referring to the type of paper that you physically write on. This is **[Paper](https://www.dilanxd.om/paper)** (also known as **paper.nu**), a course planning and scheduling tool used by thousands of Northwestern University students to easily organize things like a four-year plan or a schedule for the upcoming quarter. While most people don't really care about how it works (just that it does!), I thought I'd share some of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes for those that might be interested!

## The tech stack

Paper is entirely [open source](https://github.com/dilanx/paper.nu) and is a [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) written pretty much entirely in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), with [React](https://reactjs.org) for the user interface, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, and [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) (and its dependencies) as the build tool.
